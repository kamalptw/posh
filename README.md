# posh Content Management System
projects here @ posh_cms
This is a Rails web application that is built on Rails 3.2.3
It is a simple content management system loaded with admin control and session management!
You can use this as a high school project or a college project. Read my reflections to know what I learnt during each Lynda lesson on Rails.
It has been an exciting and revelatory journey for me thus far. I hope you find it useful too!
