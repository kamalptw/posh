1. What are templates and how do you render them?
=> in rails 1.0 inside the controller you would have to type in 
render (:action => 'hello') to render the hello template in demo folder
in more recent versions it wud be
render (:template =>'demo/hello') or
render (:template =>'hello')

in the latest version 3.0 its simply
render('hello') or
render('demo/hello')
both work

Again rails uses sensible defaults so in the demo controller ruby file
for example., def hello render('hello') end #was not even there, it automatically checked the views/demo/hello.html.erb file and rendered it
